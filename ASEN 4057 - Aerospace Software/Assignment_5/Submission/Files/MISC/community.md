## Availability

GitHub's training team drops by the on-demand repositories daily to answer questions and offer assistance to those who are stuck.

 We will work to answer questions within 12 hours if you ask them Monday through Friday (except on [US holidays](us-holidays/)).

In the meantime, a great way to learn new things is to explain them to others. If you see any questions you feel equipped to answer, please feel free to help!  

### GitHub Trainers

Meet the members of GitHub who will be dropping by the class repository and helping you along the way.
